Given an original and edited text file, produces a "revision" text file containing a series of instructions to turn the original into the edited version. Also includes a function that takes the original and revision file and creates the edited file. 
Useful when edits aren't large and maintain most of the original file's text, and could be used when data transfer is expensive or slow. In testing, the algorithm most often produced revision files of sizes ~10% of the original/edited files.
